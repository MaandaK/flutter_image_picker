# About App

hi Derick  

I made the image thing work you gotta choose a pic first then it will upload
the only thing i did now was to make it change in your database to that first one meterlesing m_Id 1
all the code is on the main dart
if you look in the debug console you will see all the stuff that is happening on the Api page
